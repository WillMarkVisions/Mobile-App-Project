Project description

After sitting here reflecting on my last 20 years as a newly retired Air Force member. I was looking at all my pictures but they were scattered in different places. I want to create a app where all your “Marked Visions” (experiences, goals, pictures, etc.) can come to life and all in one place. 

The version will be using Android 13.0 (Tiramisu), but the minimum SDK will be Android 5.0 which will run on approximately 98.8% of devices.

•	The readme is located in GitHub here Mobile-App-Project/README.md at main · WillMarkVisions/Mobile-App-Project (github.com)

Problem addressing
•	The amount of memory needed might be a problem. The right amount of information to add will need to be just enough at the start.

Platform
•	Android 13.0 Tiramisu

Front/Back-end support
•	Android OS, will use Java for programming language using Android Studio


Functionality
•	I want the user to be able to copy/paste, send pictures, edit, create all in one application. I want the user to change and customize the application to fit there “Marked Visions” experiences. 

Design (wireframes)
•	3 Design Wireframes

Changes (wireframes)
•	I want to implement single sign on (such as Google login), to track your already saved items. 
•	Add another wireframe to include calenders
