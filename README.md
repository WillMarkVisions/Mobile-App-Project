Mobile App Project Development 

Project description

After sitting here reflecting on my last 20 years as a newly retired Air Force member. I was looking at all my pictures but they were scattered in different places. I want to create a app where all your “Marked Visions” (experiences, goals, pictures, etc.) can come to life and on in one place. 

The version will be using Android 13.0 (Tiramisu), but the minimum SDK will be Android 5.0 which will run on approximately 98.8% of devices.
